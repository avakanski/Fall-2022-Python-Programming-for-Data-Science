    "`Assert` is typically used to verify program conditions during development (such as user-defined constraints), rather than for catching genuine programming errors. Because Python catches programming errors itself, there is usually no need to use `assert` to catch things like zero divides, out-of-bounds indexes, type mismatches, etc. In general, assertions are useful for checking  types, classes, or values of inputted variables, checking data structures such as duplicates in a list or contradictory variables, and checking that outputs of functions are reasonable and as expected.

    "One clear advantage of relative imports is that they are quite succinct, and they can turn a very long import statement into a simple and short statement. Relative imports can be messy, particularly for projects where the organization of the directories is likely to change. Relative imports are also not as readable as absolute ones, and it is not easy to tell the location of the imported names."
