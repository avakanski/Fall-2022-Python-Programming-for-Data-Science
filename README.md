# Course Description
With the increased use of data science projects for improving various functions and operations across organizations, the tools for managing such projects have matured as well. This course introduces students to Python tools and libraries that are commonly used by organizations for management of the different phases in the life cycle of data science projects. The content is divided into four main themes. The first theme reviews the basics of Python programming and extends it with advanced concepts. The second theme focuses on data engineering, and covers Python tools for data collection and exploration. The next theme overviews model engineering, and includes model design, training, testing, optimization, and packaging. The last theme introduces Data Science Operations (DSOps), and covers techniques for model serving, performance monitoring, diagnosis, and reproducibility of data science projects deployed in production.

# Learning Outcomes
Upon the completion of the course, the students should demonstrate the ability to:
1.	Understand and describe commonly used Python frameworks for life cycle management of data science projects.
2.	Apply advanced Python tools for data collection, analysis, and visualization.
3. 	Design, validate, and justify the selection of data science models using statistical approaches, data mining, and machine learning methods. 
4.	Implement algorithms for image and natural language processing using Python-based frameworks. 
5.	Understand the main characteristics of existing Python libraries for deployment, continuous integration, and monitoring of data science projects.
6.	Deploy data science models on cloud servers and edge devices.
