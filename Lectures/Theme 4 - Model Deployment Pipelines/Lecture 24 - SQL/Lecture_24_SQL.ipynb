        "***SQL (Structured Query Language)*** is a programming language designed for managing data in Relational Data Base Management Systems (RDBMS), or for stream processing in Relational Data Stream Management Systems (RDSMS). A *relational database* is a database that stores related information across multiple tables, and allows to query information in more than one table at the same time. Within a table, the data is organized in a tabular format with rows and columns. \n",
        "\n",
        "SQL was initially developed in 1970, and since then different companies and vendors implemented SQL in their products with some variations. To bring greater conformity in the variants of SQL, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) published the first SQL standard in 1986. The standard has been updated every few year since then. \n",
        "\n",
        "Today, there are several variants of SQL for database management systems available, some of which were developed by companies such as IBM and Oracle, as well as there are variants developed by communities, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. Although these variants of SQL have certain differences, they are based on the basic SQL syntax, and are quite similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main advantages of SQL include standardized syntax (all relational database systems have an SQL query interpreter built-in), and easy-to-understand with English-like commands and functions. "

        "***Relational*** databases store information in multiple tables, which allows to work with more complex data,and have flexibility in the way the data is organized. An example is shown in the next figure, where a database is shown that is used for managing HR data of a small business. \n",
        "\n",
        "This database has seven tables:\n",
        "- Jobs table stores data related to job title and salary range.\n",
        "- Employees table stores the data of employees.\n",
        "- Dependents table stores the employee’s dependents.\n",
        "- Departments table stores department data.\n",

        "- Locations table stores the location of the departments of the company.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each table contains many records with rows and columns (similar to an Excel spreadsheet), and the records have relationships across the tables. Using multiple tables in a relational database allows us to avoid duplication of information, in comparison to using a single table to store all information. Also, it provides flexibility in how we work with the data. To establish relationships between the records in different tables we need to use an ID or identifier for each employee. The identifier for each employee, or in general for each record (row) in a relational database, is referred to as *primary key*. For instance, each employee can be assigned an ID value (such as employee 162), and each table would have an ID column (primary key column) to establish the relationship with the other tables in the database. \n",

        "SQL is a very important tool for data scientists, data analysts, developers, and database administrators. In particular, as many companies become data-driven, SQL becomes an essential tool for handing data stored in databases and performing various data analytics operations, such as calculating data statistics, handling missing values, removing duplicate columns, updating records, calculating correlations between records, and similar. \n",

        "### SQL versus Pandas\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL has similarities with the Pandas library, as it offers similar functionality to Pandas, which includes data manipulation over rows and columns, data merging, grouping, dealing with missing values, and similar. However, Pandas is not a relational database management library, but it is a data frame library. \n",
        "\n",
        "Still, Pandas offers additional functions and flexibility for handling and manipulating tabular data, and many users download databases to their local machine, and afterward use Pandas for data processing, rather than using SQL to process the data on the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "The benefits of using SQL or Pandas can depend on the task. Several considerations include:\n",
        "- In the case of a large database of information (e.g., GigaBytes of data), downloading the database to the local machine to be processed by Pandas may be slow or infeasible. Pandas is more suitable for processing small to medium size databases in Python. \n",
        "- Even if the user can download the data on the local machine for processing with Pandas, it may be required to apply some level of preprocessing or organizing the data on the server using SQL.\n",
        "- Some tasks can require that the data processing is done in the existing database. Also, when the tasks require fast data retrieval and processing, SQL can be more efficient that Pandas. \n",

        "### SQLite\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lecture, we will use SQLite that implements a self-contained, serverless SQL database engine. SQLite is lightweight in terms of setup and required recourses. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process, and it reads and writes directly to disk files. That is, it does not use the client/server model. Because it has no server managing access to it, SQLite is not suitable in multiuser environments where multiple people can simultaneously edit files."
