For instance, in NLP, self-attention mechanism is used to identify words in sentences that have significance for a given (query) word in the sentence.

Transformers use the self-attention mechanism to model the relationships between all words in a sentence, and assign weights to the other words in sentences based on their importance. In the left subfigure, the mechanism estimated that the ***query word*** \"it\" is most related to the word \"street\", but the word \"it\" is also somewhat related to the words \"The\" and \"animal.

However, the original Transformer was developed for machine translation, where the words in the target language are queries, and the words in the source language are pairs of keys and values.

Differently from the text classification task where for an input text sentence the model predicts a class label, in machine translation for an input text sentence in a source language the model predicts the corresponding text sentence in a target language. Therefore, both the input and output of the model are text sequences. These type of models are called ***sequence-to-sequence models***, or oftentimes this term is abbreviated to ***seq2seq models***. Beside machine translation, other NLP tasks that employ seq2seq models include question answering, text summarization, dialog generation, and others. \n",

The upper part of the decoder is practically the same as the encoder, and it consists of a multi-head attention module with residual connections and layer normalization, followed by a feed-forward network with residual connections and layer normalization. The output of the encoder is passed to the multi-head attention module.\n",

This module is inserted between the target sequence (i.e., the output sequence of the decoder) and the multi-head attention module. Masked multi-head attention module applies masking to the next words in the target sequence, so that the network does not have access to those words. That is, during training, if the model needs to predict the 4th word in a sentence, masks will be applied to all words after the 3rd word, so that the model has access only to the words 1, 2, and 3, in order to predict the 4th word. This step ensures that the model uses only the previous steps to predict the word in the next step in the target sequence. This type of mask is also referred to as *causal attention mask*.\n",

        "After the initial success of Transformer Networks in NLP, recently they have been adapted for computer vision tasks as well. The initial Transformer model for vision tasks proposed in 2021 was called ***Vision Transformer (ViT)***. \n",
        "\n",
        "The architecture of ViT is very similar to the Transformers used in NLP. However, Transformer Networks were designed for working with sequential data, while images are spatial data types. To consider each pixel in an image as a sequential token would be impractical and too time-consuming. Therefore, ViT splits images into a set of smaller image patches (16x16 pixels), and it uses the sequence of image patches as inputs to the model. Each image patch was first flattened to one-dimensional vector, and those vectors were afterward passed through a dense layer to learn lower-dimensional embeddings for each patch. Positional embeddings were added, and the sequences were fed to a standard transformer encoder. The encoder block in ViT is identical to the encoder in the original Transformer Network. The steps are depicted in the figure below. \n",

These models achieved higher accuracy on many vision tasks in comparison to Convolutional Neural Networks. The following figure shows the current accuracy on ImageNet. \n",
